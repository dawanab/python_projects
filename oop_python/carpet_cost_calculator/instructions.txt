The Carpet Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the price 
of carpeting for rectangular rooms. To calculate the price, you multiply the area 
of the floor (width * length) by the price per square meter of carpet. 
    > For example, the area of the floor that's 12 m long and 10 m wide is 120 square meters. 
    To cover the floor with a carpet that costs $8 per square meter would cost $960.

1. Write a class with the name Floor. The class needs two instance variables
with the names width and length.
    > The class needs to have one constructor with parameters width and length,
    and it needs to initialize the fields.
    > In case the width parameter is less than 0, it needs to set the width field value to 0.
    > In case the length parameter is less than 0, it needs to set the length field value to 0.

    Write the following instance methods:
        * get_area with no parameters; returns the calculated area (width * length).

2. Write a class with the name Carpet. The class needs one instance variable named cost.
    > The class needs to have one constructor with parameter cost; initialize the field.
    > In case the cost parameter is less than 0, it needs to set the cost field value to 0.

    Write the following instance methods:
        * get_cost with no parameters; returns the value of cost field

3. Write a class with the name Calculator. The class needs two instance variables 
with the names floor of type Floor, and carpet of type Carpet.
    > The class needs to have one constructor with parameters floor of type Floor,
    and carpet of type Carpet; initialize the fields.

    Write the following methods (instance methods):
        * get_total_cost with no parameters; returns the calculated total cost 
        to cover the floor with a carpet.
