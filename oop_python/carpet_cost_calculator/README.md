# Carpet Cost Calculator: 
---
> The Carpet Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the price 
of carpeting for rectangular rooms. To calculate the price, you multiply the area 
of the floor (width * length) by the price per square meter of carpet. 

*For example, the area of the floor that's 12 m long and 10 m wide is 120 square meters. 
To cover the floor with a carpet that costs $8 per square meter would cost $960.*
